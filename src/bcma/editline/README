This package was obtained in 1999 and modified to fit the Broadcom
SDK. In 2015 is was modified further to perform terminal I/O through
call-backs, and several unused FSF compatibility functions were
removed. For SDK purposes, the library can still be replaced by the
FSF readline library.

The original library is maintained at GitHub:
https://github.com/troglobit/editline

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ORIGINAL DESCRIPTION

This is a line-editing library.  It can be linked into almost any
program to provide command-line editing and recall.

It is call-compatible with the FSF readline library, but it is a
fraction of the size (and offers fewer features).  It does not use
standard I/O.  It is distributed under a "C News-like" copyright.
