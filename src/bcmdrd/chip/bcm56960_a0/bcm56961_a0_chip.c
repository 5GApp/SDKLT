 * 3. Grant of Patent License
 *    Subject to the terms and conditions of this license, each Licensor 
 *    grants to you a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, and royalty-free 
 *    patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and 
 *    otherwise transfer its Work, in whole or in part. This patent license 
 *    applies only to the patent claims licensable by Licensor that would be 
 *    infringed by Licensor's Work (or portion thereof) individually and 
 *    excluding any combinations with any other materials or technology.
 *    If you institute patent litigation against any Licensor (including a 
 *    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) to enforce any patents that 
 *    you allege are infringed by any Work, then your patent license from such 
 *    Licensor to the Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is 
 *    filed.
 * 4. Redistribution
 *    You may reproduce or distribute the Work only if (a) you do so under 
 *    this License, (b) you include a complete copy of this License with your

 *    reproduce the notices described in this license.
 * 7. Limitations
 *    Platform. The Work and any derivative works thereof may only be used, or 
 *    intended for use, with a Broadcom switch integrated circuit.
 *    No Reverse Engineering. You will not use the Work to disassemble, 
 *    reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to ascertain the underlying 
 *    technology of a Broadcom switch integrated circuit.
 * 8. Termination
 *    If you violate any term of this license, then your rights under this 
 *    license (including the license grants of Sections 2 and 3) will 
 *    terminate immediately.
 * 9. Disclaimer of Warranty
