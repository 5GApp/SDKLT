/*!
 * \brief Per-source interrupt handler.
 *
 * A per-source interrupt handler must be defined for each of enabled
 * interrupt sources (corresponding to the individual bits in the
 * interrupt status registers).
 *
 * When a per-source interrupt handler is installed, an associated
 * context value is passed in as well, and this context value will be
 * passed to the interrupt handler, when an interrupt occurs.
 *
 * A typical use case for the context value is to allow the interrupt
 * handler to separate interrupt sources from each other, when the
 * same handler is assigned to multiple interrupt sources of the same
 * type.
 *
 * For example, if same handler serves multiple DMA channels of the
 * same type, the context value can indicate the DMA channel number.
 *
 * \param [in] unit Unit number.
 * \param [in] intr_param Additional interrupt context.
