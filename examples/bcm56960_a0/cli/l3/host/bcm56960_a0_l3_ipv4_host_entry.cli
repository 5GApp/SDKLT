# Purpose: Demonstrate IPv4 unicast host routing using regular nexthop.

# Description: Host route entry VRF = 0 + IPv4 = 192.168.0.100 routes to
#              nexthop 2 and would send the packet out of port 1.

# Setup diagram:
#                    +--------------------------+ nexthop 2
#                    |                          | port: 1

# Ingress port(s): 2

# Egress ports(s): 1.

# Notes:
#   This is self contained script i.e. it programs all the forwarding path.

# Verification method:
#    Use packet sampling to capture the modified packet on port 1 and check
#    if it is as below:
