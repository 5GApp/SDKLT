# Purpose: To demonstrate the derivation of PHB parameters from the packet
# priority (802.1p) and CFI fields of the incoming L2 packet.

# Description: L2 packet ingresss on port 1 and derives internal priority and
# color of the packet. Based on these PHB parameters, the packet gets queued in
# UC queue and gets switched to port 2 with priority remark at egress.

# Setup diagram:

# Ingress port(s): 1.

# Egress ports(s): 2.

# Egress CoS queue: 6.

# Device: bcm56960_a0.

# NGSDK Version: 0.8

# Notes: This is a self sufficient script i.e. it programs all the logical
# tables required to derive PHB parameters for L2 switching.

# Verification method: Packet sampling is enabled on port 2 to capture the
# egressing packet, that should have 802.1p priority=6 and CFI=0. The captured
# packet is given below:
