# Purpose: Demonstrate egress RSPAN mirroring.

# Description: Packet with destination MAC as 0x000000BBBBBB ingresses on
#              port 2 and gets switched to port 1.
#              Enabled egress mirroring on port 1 and configured MTP port
#              as port 3.
#              A copy of egress packet will be sent to the MTP port with
#              RSPAN VLAN tag.

# Setup diagram:

# Ingress port(s): 2.

# Egress ports(s): 1.

# Egress COS queue: Not relevant.

# Device: bcm56960_a0.

# NGSDK Version: 0.7

# Notes: Script is self-contained i.e. it configures all logical tables
#        required to make egress RSPAN mirroring work.

# Verification method: Use packet sampling to capture the modified packet
#                      on port 3 and check if it is as below:
